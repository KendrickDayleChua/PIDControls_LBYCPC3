# PIDControls_LBYCPC3
Project Specifications
Implementati on of PID Control using MATLAB
1. Write a MATLAB program that accepts user inputs for the following:
1a. System Transfer Functi on coeffi cients (2nd order) % sys=tf (c, [a b c])
Use negati ve unity feedback.
1b. Prior to inserti ng PID control, generate the following: Impulse, Step Input. Ramp Input, Parabolic, PZ Map
Note: Use lsim for the ramp response and parabolic response.
2. Ask the user to provide the coeffi cients of the PID controller: Kp, Kd and Ki and generate the following:
2a. Equivalent System Transfer Functi on (PID cascaded with the original transfer functi on)
2b. Generate the following: Impulse, Step Input. Ramp Input, Parabolic, PZ Map
